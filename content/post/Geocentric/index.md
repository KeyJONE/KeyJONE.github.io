## Overview

1. Geocentric is a simulation platform built on the [deal.II](https://www.dealii.org/) finite-element library, [p4est](https://p4est.org/) mesh handling library, and the [Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io/) project. It is not an open-source software, so this instruction is just written for myself ‚ù§Ô∏è.
2. Installation is not a very simple task, compared with the installation of commerical FEM softwares.
3. Fortunately, we have the [The deal.II/ASPECT virtual machine image](https://www.math.clemson.edu/~heister/dealvm/), which implies we do not need to install deal.II or its dependencies manually üëã.


### Procedure

- [ ] Download <mark>dealvm_1.21.ova</mark> from the above website.
- [ ] Download the [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and install it.
- [ ] Import the <mark>dealvm_1.21.ova</mark> into the VirtualBox by following the basic instructions (default setting should be enough).

- [ ] Rename the folder name to **eigen3** and move it to the following directory.

      ```
      tar -xzvf eigen-3.4.0.tar.gz
      mv eigen-3.4.0 eigen3
      mv eigen3 /home/ubuntu/deal.II/installed/include/
      ```

- [ ] Run the simple test file
