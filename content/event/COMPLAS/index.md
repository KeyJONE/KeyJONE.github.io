title: Anisotropic poromechanics of gas flow in sedimentary rocks

event: XVII International Conference on Computational Plasticity, COMPLAS 2023
event_url: https://complas2023.cimne.com/

location: Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain

summary: Presentation at the COMPLAS 2023. We mainly talk about the incorporation of anisotropic elastoplastic deformation into the shale gas apparent permeability models.

abstract: Solid deformation is always a crucial factor in the shale gas transport model. While previous studies always adopt the assumption of isotropic poroelastic deformation, anisotropic poroelastoplastic deformation is rarely considered, despite the anisotropy being a ubiquitous property of natural rocks. In this work, an anisotropic poromechanical model is established to analyze the matrix porosity and apparent permeability evolutions during the process of shale gas migration. A recently developed constitutive model appropriate for rocks exhibiting transverse isotropy in both the elastic and plastic responses is adopted in this work. Through the stress point simulation, a new **double-U** shape curve of apparent permeability is obtained, which cannot be reproduced from the assumption of isotropic poroelasticity.
